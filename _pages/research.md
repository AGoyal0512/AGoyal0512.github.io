### Ph.D. Research



### Undergraduate Research

I had the privilege of getting into formal research early during my undergraduate degree, which gave me the opportunity to explore various domains and get used to the process of academic research, reviewing, etc.

As a result, I worked on projects and published papers in various domains under machine learning and deep learning. This included the development and utilization of Matrix and Tensor Decomposition techniques to understand emergent or latent properties of complex dynamical systems, Computer Vision (medical imaging and model reprogramming), and Natural Language Processing (cognitive sciences, generative agent simulations).

I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Hanbaek Lyu](https://hanbaeklyu.com/) with who I started working on during a [Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)](https://hanbaeklyu.com/reu/) program on machine learning approaches to coupled oscillator dynamics. I was also advised by [Dr. Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/), and collaborated with [Dr. Tim Rogers](http://psych.wisc.edu/Rogers/) as part of the [HuLab](https://junjiehu.github.io/#group) and [Knowledge and Concepts Lab](http://concepts.psych.wisc.edu) respectively, where I worked on taking cognitive science based approaches for the alignment of LLM-based agents with human social networks.

### Collaborations

I am always happy to collaborate or discuss ideas related to common research interests. Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to collaborate on something!

I have previously collaborated and continue to do so closely with researchers from academia including [Siddharth Suresh (UW-Madison)](https://www.sidsuresh.com/), [Yun-Shiuan Chuang (UW-Madison)](https://yunshiuan.github.io/), [Diganta Misra (MPI)](https://digantamisra98.github.io/), [Richard Paul Yim (UCSF)](https://www.richpaulyim.com/), as well as industry researchers including [Pin-Yu Chen (IBM-Research)](https://sites.google.com/site/pinyuchenpage/home).
