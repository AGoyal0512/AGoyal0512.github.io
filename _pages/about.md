I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), where I am working on making large language models more aligned with human values and their applications in social settings.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) where I graduated with a B.S. with [Comprehensive Honors](https://honors.ls.wisc.edu/honors-degree-tracks/#comprehensive-honors), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), [Mathematics](https://math.wisc.edu/), and [Data Science](https://datascience.wisc.edu/), with a minor in [Economic Analytics](https://econ.wisc.edu/).

I am currently working as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern at [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the EC2 Modernization team. Last summer, I also worked as an SDE intern at [Amazon]("https://twitter.com/amazon") on the Alexa Devices Speech Middleware team, where I worked on making it easier for applications to achieve [Alexa](https://twitter.com/alexa99) Voice Integration and built an application to help automate the end-to-end testing of Alexa's Speech functionalities.
