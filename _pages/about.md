I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), co-advised by [Prof. Hari Sundaram](https://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/index.html) and [Prof. Eshwar Chandrasekharan](http://www.eshwarchandrasekharan.com). I also collaborate closely with [Prof. Koustuv Saha](https://koustuv.com). Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) advised by [Prof. Hanbaek Lyu](https://hanbaeklyu.com/) and [Prof. Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/).

My research focuses on aligning GenAI technologies with diverse human values and exploring questions around their safe integration in social contexts. I also study the application of NLP techniques more broadly in computational understanding, modeling, and governance of online communities. For more details on my research interests, see [this page](/research/). My work is graciously supported in part by the [Cohere For AI Research Grant Program](https://cohere.com/blog/c4ai-research-grants) and the [OpenAI Researcher Access Program](https://openai.com/form/researcher-access-program/). 

Currently, I am working as a Ph.D. Research Intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), mentored by [Dr. Apoorv Saxena](https://apoorvumang.github.io) and [Dr. Koyel Mukherjee](https://research.adobe.com/person/koyel-mukherjee/). My project involves exploring continual learning techniques for LLMs to enhance contextual faithfulness in generation.

<!-- Previously, I was an undergraduate student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) where I graduated with a B.S. with [Comprehensive Honors](https://honors.ls.wisc.edu/honors-degree-tracks/#comprehensive-honors), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), [Mathematics](https://math.wisc.edu/), and [Data Science](https://datascience.wisc.edu/), with a minor in [Economic Analytics](https://econ.wisc.edu/). -->
<!-- 
Over the last two summers, I worked as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern at [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) in the EC2 Modernization team (2024), developing an RAG-based framework for decompiled C# source code summarization, and on the [Alexa](https://twitter.com/alexa99) Devices Speech Middleware team (2023), working on making it easier for applications to achieve Alexa Voice Integration and built an application to help automate the end-to-end testing of Alexa's Speech functionalities. -->
